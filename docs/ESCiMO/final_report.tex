Grid Manufacturing (GM) is a new production paradigm, based upon the use of standardized and modular Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS).\cite{SICE13}
A production unit in a RMS is called an equiplet.
Each equiplet contains interchangeable modules. 
These hardware modules have software counterparts.
In this report we look at the realisation of the state machines build into the software counterparts of modules and equiplets as well as the realisation of a SCADA for the equiplet with its modules.

\chapter{Introduction}
In the 6th semester of our course Computer Science at the University of Applied Science Utrecht we participated in the Ubiquitous Computing specialisation.

\section{Ubiquitous computing}
Ubiquitous computing is a specialisation about information processing in everyday objects.\cite{wiki_ubicomp}
This years project is integrated with the "factories of the future" project.\cite{ubi_project_note}
In factories of the future the university of applied science Utrecht tries to develop an autonomous production line using Grid Manufacturing and Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS).

\section{Equiplet, SCada, MOdules (ESCiMO)}
In our ubiquitous computing project we are developing a system to control a production unit in an RMS called equiplet. 

Equiplets contain interchangeable modules. 
You can reconfigure an equiplet by changing its modules.
Because modules can be changed on the fly, the equiplet has to dynamically adapt to its new configuration.
Due to the autonomous nature of equiplets they can receive instruction at any time.

To ensure safe operation, modules may not start processing instructions when an operator is working on an equiplet. Therefore a secondary safety mechanism has to be developed.

We have realized such a safety mechanism in form of a state machine in each equiplet and module alongside with a SCADA system.
